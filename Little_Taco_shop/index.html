                    <summary>What role did the taquería play in Mexican history? Who ate there?</summary>
                    <p>
                        The taquería has been a staple of Mexican culture and cuisine for centuries. These establishments, which specialize in serving tacos, have historically been frequented by a diverse clientele, including laborers, families, and tourists. They serve as important social hubs where people gather to enjoy affordable and delicious food. The taquería reflects the rich culinary traditions of Mexico and has played a significant role in the country's gastronomic identity.

                    <summary>When does the taco become a mainstream American food?</summary>
                    <p>
                        The taco began to gain popularity in the United States in the early 20th century, particularly in areas with large Mexican populations, such as California and Texas. However, it wasn't until the 1950s and 1960s, with the rise of fast food chains and the increasing influence of Mexican cuisine on American food culture, that the taco truly became a mainstream American food. Today, tacos are enjoyed by people of all backgrounds and are a beloved staple of American cuisine.
